CS 360 Mobile Architect and Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    This app is used to track items inventory in a warehouse. The database used for the inventory app includes one database to store the inventory items and another to store usersâ€™ logins and credentials.The goal of the app is to design three different screens including the login, a grid view and enter view. 
    
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    The screens were the login screen, inventory screen and edit/modify inventory screen. The login screen allows the user to login into their current or an existing account in the app or create a new account. The inventory management screen displays a grid of each item SKU in inventory. The modify screen shows an input box that allows the user to edit or enter a new entry for their inventory. 
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    I approached the process of coding for my applicaiton by reviewing lessons learned in ZYBooks modules and checking over rubrics for what the course objective is. I also looked at the basics of how to use Android Studio via Youtube to get a better sense of how to use the platform. This taught me how to switch screens, views, ehat each function means, etc. So far, I would say I like using Android Studio!
    
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I tested to ensure my code was functional by consistently debugging my code and maying attention to errors. I used the Android Studio Debugger to make sure each written function to make sure it works as expected without issue before I moved onto the next. 
    
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    I would say when it came to using the layouts in Android Studio, it was much more difficult than I tought. What had made sense to me, was looking very different when executed. I had to play around with this a bit and move boxes around while lookig at code to understand what went wrong. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I think that my planning worked the most successful in this project. I come from a business background, so the planning and researching definately was second nature to me.
